You can get System Storage Manager from the git repository on SourceForge
project page http://sourceforge.net/p/storagemanager/code/. There are two
branches: ``master`` which contains stable release and ``devel``
when the development is happening. Once in a while ``devel`` branch is
merged into ``master`` releasing new version of System Storage Manager.
Obviously ``devel`` branch is more up-to-date, however it might not be
as stable as ``master`` branch. System Storage Manager have its own
regression testing suite, so we're trying hard not to break things
that already works.

You can check out ``master`` branch of the git repository::

    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/storagemanager/code ssm
