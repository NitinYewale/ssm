This command adds **device** into the pool. The **device** will not be added if
it's already part of different pool. When multiple devices are provided,
all of them are added into the pool. If one of the devices can not be added
into the pool for some reason, it will be skipped. If no pool is specified,
default pool will be chosen. In the case of non existing pool, it will be
created using provided devices.
