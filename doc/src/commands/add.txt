This command adds **device** into the pool. The **device** will not be added if
it's already part of different pool by default, but user will be asked whether
to remove the device from it's pool. When multiple devices are provided,
all of them are added into the pool. If one of the devices can not be added
into the pool for any reason, add command will fail. If no pool is specified,
default pool will be chosen. In the case of non existing pool, it will be
created using provided devices.
