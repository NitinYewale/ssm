Change size of the **volume** and file system. If there is no file system only
the **volume** itself will be resized. You can specify **device** to add into
the **volume** pool prior the resize. Note that **device** will only be added
into the pool if the **volume** size is going to grow.

If the **device** is already used in the different pool, then **ssm** will
ask you whether you want to remove it from the original pool.

In some cases file system has to be mounted in order to resize. This will be
handled by **ssm** automatically by mounting the **volume** temporarily.
