Change size of the **volume** and file system. If there is no file system only
the **volume** itself will be resized. You can specify **device** to add into
the **volume** pool prior the resize, but only so many devices will be added
to cover the new size. It meas, that if the resize will fit into the existing
pool, no devices will be added into the pool.

In some cases file system has to be mounted in order to resize. This will be
handled by **ssm** automatically by mounting the **volume** temporarily.
