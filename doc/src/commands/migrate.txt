Move data from one device or pv to another. For btrfs and lvm their
specialized utilities are used, so the data are moved in an all-or-nothing
fashion and no other operation is needed to add/remove the devices or
rebalance the pool. This also means that the state of the source device after
the operation is undefined - the data could be purged by the utilities.
Any other device is copied with dd.
