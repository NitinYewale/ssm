This command creates a new volume with defined parameters. If **device** is
provided it will be used to create a volume, hence it will be added into the
**pool** prior the volume creation (See :ref:`Add command section
<add-command>`). More devices can be used to create a volume.

If the **device** is already used in the different pool, then **ssm** will
ask you whether you want to remove it from the original pool. If you decline,
or the removal fails, then the **volume** creation fails if the *SIZE* was
not provided. On the other hand, if the *SIZE* is provided and some devices
can not be added to the **pool** the volume creation might succeed if there
is enough space in the **pool**.

*POOL* name can be specified as well. If the pool exists new volume will be
created from that pool (optionally adding **device** into the pool). However
if the *POOL* does not exist **ssm** will attempt to create a new pool with
provided **device** and then create a new volume from this pool. If
**--backend** argument is omitted, the default **ssm** backend will be used.
Default backend is *lvm*.

**ssm** also supports creating RAID configuration, however some back-ends
might not support all the levels, or it might not support RAID at all. In
this case, volume creation will fail.

If **mount** point is provided **ssm** will attempt to mount the volume after
it is created. However it will fail if mountable file system is not present
on the volume.
