List informations about all detected devices, pools, volumes and snapshots found
in the system. **list** command can be used either alone to list all the
information, or you can request specific section only.

Following sections can be specified:

{volumes | vol}
    List information about all **volumes** found in the system.

{devices | dev}
    List information about all **devices** found in the system. Some devices are
    intentionally hidden, like for example cdrom, or DM/MD devices since those
    are actually listed as volumes.

{pools | pool}
    List information about all **pools** found in the system.

{filesystems | fs}
    List information about all volumes containing **filesystems** found in
    the system.

{snapshots | snap}
    List information about all **snapshots** found in the system. Note that some
    back-ends does not support snapshotting and some can not distinguish between
    snapshot and regular volume. in this case **ssm** will try to recognize
    volume name in order to identify **snapshot**, but if the **ssm** regular
    expression does not match the snapshot pattern, this snapshot will not be
    recognized.
