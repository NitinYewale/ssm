This command removes **item** from the system. Multiple items can be specified.
If the **item** can not be removed for some reason, it will be skipped.

**item** can represent:

device
    Remove **device** from the pool. Note that this can not be done in some
    cases where the device is used by pool. You can use **-f** argument to
    *force* removal. If the device does not belong to any pool, it will be
    skipped.

pool
    Remove the **pool** from the system. This will also remove all volumes
    created from that pool.

volume
    Remove the **volume** from the system. Note that this will fail if the
    **volume** is mounted and it can not be *forced* with **-f**.
