Take a snapshot of existing **volume**. This operation will fail if back-end
which the **volume** belongs to does not support snapshotting. Note that
you can not specify both *NAME* and *DESC* since those options are mutually
exclusive.

In some cases file system has to be mounted in order to take a snapshot of
the **volume**. This will be handled by **ssm** automatically by mounting the
**volume** temporarily.
