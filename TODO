 D Fix create so the 'size' argument is recalculated to be in Kilobytes
 - Figure out how to create better pool names so it is unique in the system and
   between the systems.
 - Use wipefs -a before using the device in add()
 - Consider using wipefs -a after removing the device
 - Remove the physical volume after it is removed from the group
 D Parse subvolumes on mounted btrfs
 D Create subvolumes on btrfs on 'create'
 - Create btrfs tests
 - Document python classes and add more documentation into the code
 - Extend python unittests to other backends
 D Write-up dependencies
 - Reorganise File structure of the project
 - Add mirror support
 - Add snapshots support
 - Add raid support
 D Licence and licence notice in the source files
 - Create readme
 - Better table alignment when the output spans multiple lines
 - Better error handling - not just plain Exception, but rather named exception
   and handle it as main() in ssm module
 D Wire in bash tests into the test_ssm.py
 D Create a way to exclude "real" system devices,pools,volumes from the ssm
   consideration for testing purposes
 - Create btrfs bash tests + figure out how to handle it (SSM_PREFIX_ONLY ??)
